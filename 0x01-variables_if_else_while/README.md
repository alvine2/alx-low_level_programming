C - Variables, if, else, while
This repository contains solutions to various C programming exercises focusing on variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops.

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It then prints whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

The output of the program should be:

csharp
Copy code
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
1. The last digit
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It then prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

The output of the program should be:

csharp
Copy code
The string "Last digit of", followed by
n, followed by
The string "is", followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
if the last digit of n is 0: the string "and is 0"
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

3. alphABET
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. It excludes the letters 'q' and 'e'. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

5. Numbers
This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

6. Numberz
This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. It does not use any variable of type char and only uses the putchar function. It should contain code only in the main function.

7. Smile in the mirror
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

8. Hexadecimal
This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. The numbers are separated by a comma and a space. The numbers are printed in ascending order. It only uses the putchar function and should contain code only in the main function.

10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This program prints all possible
